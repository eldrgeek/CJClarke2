**A Healthier, Safer Sheridan**

Chris "CJ" Clarke is a local small‑business owner, world‑class martial‑arts instructor, and youth mentor. He's running for City Council to bring practical, community‑first leadership to City Hall.

### Our Priorities
- **Support small businesses & safe streets.** Help local entrepreneurs thrive while making it safer to walk, bike, and drive.
- **Invest in youth programs & parks.** Expand after‑school options, scholarships, and recreation.
- **Common‑sense budgeting & transparency.** Focus on essentials, measure results, and communicate clearly.

**Get to know CJ on the [Meet Chris](/meet) page** or read about his [plan for Sheridan](/issues). Ready to help? **[Volunteer](/get-involved)** or **[Donate](/donate)** today.
