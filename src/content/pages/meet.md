## Meet Chris (CJ) Clarke

CJ is a local small‑business owner (Chi Life Movement), a world‑renowned martial‑arts instructor, and a youth mentor. He began training as a child and has spent decades teaching discipline, balance, and confidence to students of all ages. Through his dojo, he runs youth programs that help kids build healthy habits and resilience.

### Why He's Running
CJ is running for City Council to strengthen public safety, expand youth opportunities, support small businesses, and keep budgets disciplined and transparent.

### A Mentor and Community Builder
At the dojo, CJ creates a welcoming, family‑oriented space where kids and adults learn practical skills and mental focus. He believes city government should approach public service with the same values: preparation, accountability, and teamwork.
