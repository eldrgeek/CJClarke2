## Public Safety & Safe Streets

Everyone should feel safe walking, biking, or driving in Sheridan. CJ's approach is practical and community‑oriented.

### Targeted Traffic Calming {#traffic-calming}
- Work with neighborhoods to identify dangerous corridors near schools and parks.
- Use low‑cost tools like paint, signage, and flexible bollards to slow speeds.

### Safer Crossings & Lighting {#crossings-lighting}
- Improve crosswalk visibility with daylighting, lighting, and curb extensions.
- Prioritize quick‑build solutions while planning permanent upgrades.

### Coordination with Regional Partners {#regional}
- Collaborate with county and state partners on high‑injury corridors.
- Pursue grants to fund safety improvements.
