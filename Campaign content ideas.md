# Research on Sheridan (CO) City‑Council Role and Campaign Ideas for CJ Clark

## 1 Understanding the council’s job

### Structure of Sheridan’s government

* **Council–manager system:** Sheridan is governed by a mayor and six council members (two from each ward). Under the council–manager structure the council sets policy and legislation while a professional city manager implements those policies. Council members are elected to staggered four‑year terms and meet twice a month for work sessions and public meetings[\[1\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/76/Responsibilities-Qualifications#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20the%20City%20Council).

* **Qualifications:** Candidates must be U.S. citizens, registered voters, and residents of their ward for at least one year. They cannot be municipal employees or have felony convictions[\[2\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/76/Responsibilities-Qualifications#:~:text=Qualifications).

### Core responsibilities

Sheridan’s charter and Colorado law assign council members a mix of legislative, financial and representative duties:

| Responsibility | Evidence |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Make laws and set policies** | The council “adopts ordinances and resolutions” to create city policies[\[1\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/76/Responsibilities-Qualifications#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20the%20City%20Council). Council members set legislative priorities, issue bonds and annex land[\[3\]](https://coloradosprings.gov/role-city-council#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20City%20Council). |
| **Approve contracts, budgets and major projects** | Council approves city contracts and must approve the annual budget[\[1\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/76/Responsibilities-Qualifications#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20the%20City%20Council). It also adopts the strategic plan and hears major land‑use proposals such as zoning changes and redevelopment projects[\[3\]](https://coloradosprings.gov/role-city-council#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20City%20Council). |
| **Appoint and oversee** | Council appoints the city manager, city attorney and municipal judges and confirms appointments to boards and commissions[\[4\]](https://www.lakewood.org/Government/City-Council/Whats-it-like-to-serve-on-City-Council#:~:text=You%20Are%20Here%20%3A%20,to%20serve%20on%20City%20Council). The body also sits as the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency, directing urban‑renewal efforts like River Point[\[5\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/187/Sheridan-Redevelopment-Agency#:~:text=The%20Sheridan%20Redevelopment%20Agency%20is,as%20River%20Point%20at%20Sheridan). |
| **Serve as community representatives** | Council members represent residents, attend community events, respond to constituent concerns and communicate city initiatives[\[4\]](https://www.lakewood.org/Government/City-Council/Whats-it-like-to-serve-on-City-Council#:~:text=You%20Are%20Here%20%3A%20,to%20serve%20on%20City%20Council). They regularly vote on policies affecting infrastructure, economic development, public safety and social programs. |

The time commitment can be significant. Lakewood’s overview of a similar council/manager system notes weekly meetings, regular preparation time, participation in community events and responding to residents’ emails and calls[\[4\]](https://www.lakewood.org/Government/City-Council/Whats-it-like-to-serve-on-City-Council#:~:text=You%20Are%20Here%20%3A%20,to%20serve%20on%20City%20Council). Sheridan council members also sit on other boards (e.g., the Denver Regional Council of Governments and the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency) and must learn complex topics like budgets, zoning, transportation and sustainability.

## 2 Local issues that resonate with Sheridan voters

### Housing affordability and variety

* **Accessory dwelling units (ADUs):** In 2021 the city adopted Ordinance 10‑2021 allowing self‑contained accessory dwelling units on single‑family lots. The policy was the result of a two‑year community conversation and aims to increase housing supply and affordability while preserving neighborhood character[\[6\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/453/Accessory-Dwelling-Units#:~:text=Accessory%20Dwelling%20Units). A candidate can champion continued support for ADUs and emphasize responsible infill development.

* **Affordable apartment projects:** The city is permitting **Bonsai Flats** on South Federal Boulevard—149 below‑market apartments reserved for residents earning 30–60 % of area median income and expected to be completed in 2024[\[7\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/495/Current-Development-Projects#:~:text=Bonsai%20Flats%20,Federal%20Blvd). This shows the council’s role in zoning and low‑income housing approvals.

### Transportation safety and infrastructure

* **Safe Streets Through Sheridan:** Sheridan received a planning grant to study Federal Boulevard—an arterial corridor plagued by traffic congestion and dangerous intersections. The Safe Streets Through Sheridan plan will coordinate land use and transportation to improve safety for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers[\[8\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/493/Federal-Boulevard-Projects#:~:text=Federal%20Boulevard%20is%20one%20of,information%20as%20it%20becomes%20available). A campaign can commit to implementing this plan and securing funding for sidewalks, crosswalks and bus stop improvements.

* **Comprehensive mobility studies:** The city’s comprehensive plan references the Hampden Avenue Mobility & Safety study, South Santa Fe Drive planning and the Bear Creek Trail study[\[9\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/454/Comprehensive-Plan-and-Studies#:~:text=Sheridan%20Comprehensive%20Plan). These projects seek to upgrade major corridors, reduce accidents and improve multimodal connections. Addressing traffic calming and infrastructure upgrades shows attentiveness to quality‑of‑life issues.

### Economic development and redevelopment

* **River Point redevelopment:** Sheridan partnered with private developers to transform a former landfill into **River Point at Sheridan**, a 135‑acre commercial district with dining, entertainment and retail[\[10\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/190/River-Point-at-Sheridan#:~:text=River%20Point%20at%20Sheridan). The council, sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, continues to oversee this project[\[5\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/187/Sheridan-Redevelopment-Agency#:~:text=The%20Sheridan%20Redevelopment%20Agency%20is,as%20River%20Point%20at%20Sheridan). A candidate can discuss ensuring that redevelopment brings jobs, tax revenue and community amenities while protecting the environment.

* **New projects:** Medical offices, a Dutch Bros coffee shop and other businesses are being built in the River Point area, while the **King Street Townhomes** will convert a boarding house into apartments and townhomes[\[7\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/495/Current-Development-Projects#:~:text=Bonsai%20Flats%20,Federal%20Blvd). Showing support for small businesses, mixed‑use development and responsible growth will appeal to voters seeking services and employment.

### Sustainability, environment and health

* **Sustainability plan and brownfields cleanup:** The city’s 2015 comprehensive plan and 2023 sustainability plan call for greener practices. Sheridan obtained an EPA Brownfields grant to study environmental cleanup along Federal Boulevard[\[8\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/493/Federal-Boulevard-Projects#:~:text=Federal%20Boulevard%20is%20one%20of,information%20as%20it%20becomes%20available). Advocating for clean‑up projects, renewable energy and tree planting positions a candidate as forward‑looking.

* **Food access:** Sheridan sponsors community markets and partners with non‑profits to improve access to fresh produce. A consultant reviewed zoning barriers to food retail options[\[11\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/455/Food-Access#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Sheridan%20is,showing%20sites%20and%20services%20available). A campaign could emphasize healthy food initiatives, community gardens and support for local growers.

### Services for families and older adults

* **Boomer Bond and social services:** The Boomer Bond (2017) addressed challenges facing older adults, recommending improved mobility, housing, and services[\[9\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/454/Comprehensive-Plan-and-Studies#:~:text=Sheridan%20Comprehensive%20Plan). A candidate can pledge to maintain senior‑friendly programs and accessible recreation.

* **Parks and trails:** Sheridan residents value parks and trails along the South Platte River. Investments in open space, playgrounds, and path maintenance are popular issues and align with county open‑space funding.

## 3 Demographic context

Understanding who lives in Sheridan helps tailor messaging:

* **Small population:** Sheridan has an estimated 2025 population of **5,777**, down slightly from 6,104 in 2020[\[12\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=Sheridan%20is%20a%20%20city,population%20of%206%2C104%20in%202020). With just 2.23 square miles of area, the city feels like a close‑knit community.

* **Economic diversity:** The average household income is **$72,433** and the median household income is **$58,571**, but **13.46 %** of residents live in poverty[\[13\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=The%20average%20household%20income%20in,2%20years%20for%20females)[\[14\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=Sheridan%27s%20average%20per%20capita%20income,46). Income disparities and rising costs make affordability a salient issue.

* **Young families and diverse races:** The median age is **35.1 years**, and the racial composition is 47.7 % White, 20.7 % other race, 4 % Black or African‑American, 4.7 % Native American, 3.1 % Asian and nearly 20 % reporting multiple races[\[13\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=The%20average%20household%20income%20in,2%20years%20for%20females)[\[15\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=The%20racial%20composition%20of%20Sheridan,for%20%20and%20multiracial%20populations). Messages should be inclusive and culturally sensitive.

## 4 What we know about CJ Clark’s past campaign

* In the **2023 municipal election** for Ward 3, CJ Clark (sometimes listed as Chris Clarke) received **162 votes**, losing to former council member **Ernie Camacho**, who received **200 votes**[\[16\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/557/2023-Elections-Results#:~:text=Election%20Results%202023). The official results were certified on 28 Nov 2023[\[16\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/557/2023-Elections-Results#:~:text=Election%20Results%202023). He has therefore already built some name recognition and likely has a base of supporters.

Although official biographies are not readily available, it is clear that CJ Clark is running again in the **2025 election**. As his campaign manager, you can craft a narrative that highlights his roots in Sheridan, dedication to public service, and commitment to representing Ward 3.

## 5 Content ideas for CJ Clark’s website and campaign

### Personal story and qualifications

1. **Introduce CJ Clark as a neighbor:** Begin with a compelling biography describing his long‑term residency, family ties and community involvement (volunteering, youth coaching, serving on homeowners’ associations or planning commissions). Emphasize that he understands Ward 3 because he lives the same everyday experiences as voters.

2. **Professional expertise:** If CJ has experience in business, construction, public safety or non‑profits, explain how these skills translate to good government—budget management, problem solving, negotiation and empathy. Explain any prior service on boards or committees.

3. **Reason for running:** Frame his candidacy as motivated by a desire to improve quality of life—safer streets, affordable housing, transparent government, thriving parks and small businesses. Connect his experiences (e.g., struggles with housing costs, dealing with traffic on Federal Boulevard, raising children, caring for aging parents) to policy priorities.

### Issues page

Organize the issues section with clear headings; each topic should connect to the council responsibilities and local concerns outlined above.

1. **Safe streets and infrastructure:** Pledge to champion the Safe Streets Through Sheridan plan, fund sidewalk improvements, enforce speed limits and install better lighting. Highlight the need for accessible transit, safe crossings for children and seniors, and improved bus shelters. Discuss working with state agencies on the Hampden Avenue and South Santa Fe Drive studies[\[8\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/493/Federal-Boulevard-Projects#:~:text=Federal%20Boulevard%20is%20one%20of,information%20as%20it%20becomes%20available)[\[9\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/454/Comprehensive-Plan-and-Studies#:~:text=Sheridan%20Comprehensive%20Plan).

2. **Housing affordability:** Support ADUs and mixed‑income projects like Bonsai Flats[\[6\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/453/Accessory-Dwelling-Units#:~:text=Accessory%20Dwelling%20Units)[\[7\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/495/Current-Development-Projects#:~:text=Bonsai%20Flats%20,Federal%20Blvd). Advocate for inclusionary housing policies and creative solutions such as adaptive reuse of commercial spaces for housing. Stress that seniors and young families should be able to remain in Sheridan.

3. **Economic development:** Celebrate successes like River Point but insist that future redevelopment includes local hiring, small business incubators, community benefits (parks, sidewalks) and environmental clean‑up[\[10\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/190/River-Point-at-Sheridan#:~:text=River%20Point%20at%20Sheridan)[\[5\]](https://ci.sheridan.co.us/187/Sheridan-Redevelopment-Agency#:~:text=The%20Sheridan%20Redevelopment%20Agency%20is,as%20River%20Point%20at%20Sheridan). Propose supporting entrepreneurs through streamlined permitting, façade grants and pop‑up market programs.

4. **Sustainability and environment:** Commit to implementing Sheridan’s sustainability plan—expanding tree canopy, promoting renewable energy on city buildings and supporting brownfield remediation[\[8\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/493/Federal-Boulevard-Projects#:~:text=Federal%20Boulevard%20is%20one%20of,information%20as%20it%20becomes%20available). Mention interest in solar garden partnerships or EV‑charging stations. Connect sustainability to cost savings for residents.

5. **Food access and healthy living:** Advocate for farmers’ markets, community gardens and zoning changes to allow small food retailers[\[11\]](https://co-sheridan.civicplus.com/455/Food-Access#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Sheridan%20is,showing%20sites%20and%20services%20available). Propose working with schools and non‑profits to expand nutrition programs.

6. **Inclusive community and transparency:** Pledge to hold regular ward meetings, respond promptly to constituent emails and texts and provide Spanish‑language translation at meetings. Commit to budget transparency, accessible public documents and inclusive policy‑making that considers Sheridan’s diverse racial make‑up[\[15\]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/colorado/sheridan#:~:text=The%20racial%20composition%20of%20Sheridan,for%20%20and%20multiracial%20populations).

### Campaign marketing ideas

1. **Logo and slogan:** Develop a simple, memorable logo featuring Sheridan’s colors or landmarks (the bridge over the South Platte River). Use a slogan such as *“Safe Streets, Strong Neighborhoods – CJ Clark for Ward 3.”* Marketing experts recommend using a consistent logo and slogan across yard signs, T‑shirts and digital platforms to build recognition[\[17\]](https://www.aristotle.com/blog/2023/08/top-8-local-election-campaign-ideas/#:~:text=Eight%20Ideas%20for%20a%20Local,Election%20Campaign).

2. **Story‑telling and testimonials:** Share short videos of CJ explaining why he’s running, interspersed with stories from supporters (e.g., a senior who worries about crossing Federal Boulevard or a young family benefiting from an ADU). Aristotle’s campaign tips emphasize telling a story to build an emotional connection with voters[\[17\]](https://www.aristotle.com/blog/2023/08/top-8-local-election-campaign-ideas/#:~:text=Eight%20Ideas%20for%20a%20Local,Election%20Campaign).

3. **Comprehensive website:** Build a modern, responsive website with the issues pages above, volunteer/donate forms and a calendar of events. Use email sign‑ups and newsletters to keep supporters informed, as digital outreach is a cost‑effective way to target voters[\[17\]](https://www.aristotle.com/blog/2023/08/top-8-local-election-campaign-ideas/#:~:text=Eight%20Ideas%20for%20a%20Local,Election%20Campaign). Include translation options to reach Spanish‑speaking residents.

4. **Social media strategy:** Use Facebook to engage older residents and Instagram/TikTok for younger voters. Highlight community events, behind‑the‑scenes campaign moments, quick polls (“What’s your biggest concern on Federal Blvd?”) and live Q\&A sessions. Promote volunteer canvassing days and door‑knocking.

5. **Ground game:** Analyze voter data to determine a “win number” and target likely supporters, as advised by local campaign guides[\[18\]](https://callhub.io/blog/political-campaign/run-local-political-campaign/#:~:text=vote%20before,electoral%20office%20in%20your%20district). Recruit volunteers for door‑to‑door canvassing, focusing on high‑turnout neighborhoods and apartment complexes in Ward 3. Provide bilingual materials and emphasize contactless options (drop‑door literature) where appropriate.

6. **Partnerships and endorsements:** Seek endorsements from neighborhood associations, environmental groups, and small‑business owners. Participate in local events such as Sheridan Celebrates, farmers’ markets and school functions to build visibility. Attend city council meetings and speak during public comment to demonstrate engagement.

7. **Community forums and listening sessions:** Host regular coffee‑hours and park meet‑ups where residents can share concerns. Provide childcare and refreshments to encourage participation. Use these sessions to inform policy proposals and demonstrate responsiveness.

### Voter outreach tactics

1. **Mailers and literature:** Design affordable flyers that introduce CJ, summarize his priorities and provide voting information. Flyers and brochures remain effective for older voters[\[17\]](https://www.aristotle.com/blog/2023/08/top-8-local-election-campaign-ideas/#:~:text=Eight%20Ideas%20for%20a%20Local,Election%20Campaign). Use door hangers for apartment complexes.

2. **Phone banking and texting:** Organize volunteers to make calls or send texts to registered voters—especially those who voted in 2021 or 2023 but may not know CJ. Tools like CallHub recommend such targeted outreach for local races[\[18\]](https://callhub.io/blog/political-campaign/run-local-political-campaign/#:~:text=vote%20before,electoral%20office%20in%20your%20district).

3. **Yard signs and T‑shirts:** Distribute yard signs and campaign T‑shirts to supporters. Aristotle’s local election guide notes that recognizable campaign apparel helps increase visibility[\[17\]](https://www.aristotle.com/blog/2023/08/top-8-local-election-campaign-ideas/#:~:text=Eight%20Ideas%20for%20a%20Local,Election%20Campaign). Encourage supporters to post photos wearing the shirt or standing with a sign on social media.

4. **Get‑out‑the‑vote (GOTV) plan:** Use early‑vote reminders via mail, text and social media. Provide rides to ballot drop‑boxes, and coordinate with community organizations to host ballot‑completion parties. Remind voters about deadlines for mail ballots and encourage them to sign up for ballot‑tracking.

## 6 Conclusion

As his campaign manager, you should frame CJ Clark as a neighbour committed to making Sheridan safer and more prosperous. The city’s council members are responsible for passing ordinances, approving budgets and contracts and representing residents[\[1\]](https://www.ci.sheridan.co.us/76/Responsibilities-Qualifications#:~:text=Responsibilities%20of%20the%20City%20Council). Understanding Sheridan’s demographic trends, pressing issues and ongoing projects allows you to tailor a message that speaks directly to Ward 3 voters. By emphasizing safe streets, affordable housing, responsible redevelopment, sustainability and transparency—and by combining a strong digital presence with grassroots engagement—you can help CJ build on his 2023 run and connect with the diverse community he hopes to serve.
